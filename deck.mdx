# Disclaimer

I am just a user of Storybook, NO EXPERT. Some people might thing this is useful, some might not. Let's make this talk quick and short.

# My Story

- Network connection is required, but sometimes it's not reliable
  - Slow network will slow you down
- Unexpected bug/exception sometimes block you
  - Should I fix that issue? 
- Feedback might a bit slow

# Storybook is NOT

- Storybook is not Angular specific. Open platform. Support almost any web platform.
- Storybook is not for building application.

---

# Setup - ng + Storybook

- `ng new`
  - Create a new angular application.
- `npx -p @storybook/cli sb init --type angular`
  - Setup angular storybook
- `npm installngx-schematics-for-storybook @storybook/cli --save-dev`
- `ng config cli.defaultCollection ngx-schematics-for-storybook`
  - Install storybook schematics so you will have story file when component is generated 
- `ng generate component`
- `npm run storybook`
  - Start up

--- 

# Mindset Changed

- Before, find a spot in the application and start addig new components. Most of time you will endup UI components with lots of business logic. Top to bottom.
- After, you can put your foucs on the components itself instead of business logic. Bottom up. End up with more reusable components.

---

# What I like so far

- Lightly fast recompiling
  - Dynamic Module
- Realise your dependencies

---

# Communication

Storybook can be deployed as an static website, very easy to access. Can be used to communicate with designer or any non-techical person.
