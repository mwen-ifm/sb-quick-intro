# Agenda

- What is Storybook
- Demo
- Q&A

---

# What is it and Why

- Consistency
  - Design language
- Reusability
- Show case
  - To the team
  - To other teams
- Shorter feedback loop

---

# It is NOT

- Storybook is not Angular specific. Open platform. Support almost any web platform.
- Storybook is not for application.


---

# Pain points

- Network connection is needed
- Unexpected exception sometimes block you
- Feedback loop might a bit slow

--- 

# Mindset shiftted

- Before, find a spot in the application and start addig new components. Most of time you will endup UI components with lots of business logic. Top to bottom.
- After, you can put your foucs on the components itself instead of business logic. Bottom up. End up with more reusable components.

---

# Benifit

- Lightly fast recompiling
  - Dynamic Module

---

# Communication

Storybook can be deployed as an static website, very easy to access. Can be used to communicate with designer or any non-techical person.

---

# Eventually

- A development platform
- A debug platform
- A testing platform
